From the Russian буржуазная лженаука (_burzhuaznaya lzhenauka_), "bourgeoise pseudocience".

«Under Stalinism, dialectical materialism was used to terrorize scientists. If a certain scientific theory was branded by Stalin’s ideologists as "idealistic" or "bourgeois," the scientist who continued to defend that theory immediately came under suspicion of political disloyalty.» - Loren R. Graham, _Science In Russia And The Soviet Union. A short history_.
